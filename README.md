# whatsapp-chat-analysis
I developed a whatsapp chat analyser and used streamlit python library for building custom web applications for machine learning 


**Prerequisites**

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

Your favorite IDE or text editor

Python 3.7 

PIP

**Set up your virtual environment**

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. The venv module does not offer all features of this library, to name just a few more prominent:

-is slower (by not having the app-data seed method),

-is not as extendable,

-cannot create virtual environments for arbitrarily installed python versions (and automatically discover these),

-is not upgrade-able via pip

**In the terminal that appears, type:**

pip install streamlit

**In the terminal that appears, use Streamlit as usual:**

streamlit run app.py

**Create an app**

import streamlit as st

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

**Requirements for the project to install**

-pip install emoji

-pip install urlextract

-pip install pandas

-pip install matplotlib
